/*
  You will need to set you own column widths in percents because I have no idea what you're wanting to do.
  Also I know you were going to include these grid classes in your markup like an asshole, so I made it so you couldn't.
  Extend them properly.

  In the origonal col widths are whack because of the padding not being distributed evenly
  but its fixed now
