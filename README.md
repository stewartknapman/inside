# Inside CSS
## A sassy skeleton framework

Inside is a sass based skeleton framework. It aims to set up some basic ground-rules and then get out of the way. That way you can then apply your own styles on top.

Everything is based on mixins so that you can keep your sass light, but you can include all the classes if you need to get something up and running quickly.

Each modules set of classes can also be turned on and off through variables so you don't have to include things that you don't need, keeping everything light and manageable.
